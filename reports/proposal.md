# Food Fest Project
Sam Coleman and Kate Mackowiak

## Project Goals

Our goal is to replicate a messenger or snapchat style game in which a player uses their camera and laptop to catch "food" in their mouth and avoid "poison". We will implement this using C++ and OpenCV. Our lower bound is identifying a face and finding the intersection between the face and a food image overlayed on top. Our stretch goal is to actually identify the mouth in the face to see if the person has "eaten" the food. We also want to make sure our game works for all skin tones. Additionally, we hope to make this project polished such that it has a proper user interface - in other words - portfolio worthy. 

## Learning Goals

Our learning goals are to continue to deepen our understanding of C++ and OpenCV. We started down this path with project one, but recognize that we still have a long way to go. We are hoping that facial recognition is a common enough task that we will be able to find a significant number of resources to use when implementing our project. 

Additionally, we want to make a professional looking project that will spice up our portfolios.

## Starting Resources

We have created a links card in Trello that will help us track links we have used. Some specific links/resources we are going to learn more about are:
- [dlib facial recognition](https://crates.io/crates/dlib-face-recognition)
- [geeks for geeks facial detection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/opencv-c-program-face-detection/)
- [OpenCV landmark detection docs](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/d42/tutorial_face_landmark_detection_in_an_image.html)


### First Steps

1. Make a initial c++ class and makefile. Done when pushed to github. -Kate
2. Explore dlib facial recognition and it's potential. Done when we have evaluated if this is a feasible route. -Sam
3. Explore opencv landmark detection docs as a potential route. Done when we have evaluated if this is a feasible route. -Kate
